Abstraction :  In java Abstraction is achieved by interfaces and abstract classes. We can achieve 100% abstraction using interfaces.

Consider a real life example, A man driving a car, he only knows pressing accelerator increases speed of the car and applying brakes will reduce the
speed of the car. But he does not know the internal mechanism of accelerator and brakes. This is what abstraction is.

'abstract' keyword is used to declare abstract class and methods.

Abstract method is a method declared without implementation. Its implementation is defined in sub class or child class.
